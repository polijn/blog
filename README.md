## tutorials

the demo blog doubles as a tutorial on how to use this template:

- [quick start with github pages](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/how-to-use)

- [adding content](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/adding-content)

- [comments and likes via bluesky](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/comments-via-bluesky)

## quick start with github pages in 5 minutes

1. Fork [the repository of this blog](https://github.com/flo-bit/blog-template) 

- Either name your fork `<github-username>.github.io` if you want your blog to live at `<github-username>.github.io` 

- Or choose any other repo name and it will live at `<github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>`

2. In your repository settings, set up github pages to deploy using github actions (_SETTINGS_ -> _PAGES_ -> _SOURCE_: **Github Actions**)

3. Set up your blog info in `src/config.ts`, most importantly the `SITE` and `BASE` variables:

- `SITE`: set to `https://<github-username>.github.io`
- `BASE`: if repo name is `<github-username>.github.io` set to `/`, otherwise set to `/<repo-name>`

4. Once you push your changes to main your blog should be live in about 1-2 minutes at 
`<github-username>.github.io` or `<github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>`

5. Set up more info in `src/config.ts` (see [all options here](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/configuring-the-blog))

- `SITE_TITLE` is the title of your blog, and will be shown in the header and in search results
- `SITE_DESCRIPTION` is the description of your blog, and will be shown e.g. in search results
- `SITE_FAVICON` is the emoji that will be shown as favicon of your blog (will be shown in the header and as favicon)
- `NAME` is the name of the author of the blog, will be shown in the footer as `(c) <YEAR> <NAME> - LICENSE`
- `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` is your bluesky handle (without the `@`), this is needed for likes and comments to work 
(see [comments via bluesky](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/comments-via-bluesky))
- `SOCIAL_LINKS` set your social media links here, e.g. `{ BLUESKY_URL: "https://bsky.app/profile/flo-bit.dev" }` 
will be shown in the footer of the blog

6. Edit `about.mdx` in `src/content/info/` to add your own about page.

7. Remove all files from `src/content/blog/` and add your own blog posts there. Time to write your first blog post! 
(see [adding content](https://flo-bit.dev/blog-template/posts/adding-content) for more info)

8. Anytime you push to the main branch, your blog will automatically be updated (should usually take less than 2 minutes). 
You can also go to the github actions tab to check the progress/status.

If you run into any issues, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/flo-bit/blog-template/issues) or
