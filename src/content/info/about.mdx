# polijns blog

hoi,  
i am polijn, and since i can think, i have a lot of brainfarts. 
so what is a brainfart? It's basically an unfiltered idea, something my brain poops out, and most of the time it's a fun idea worth nothing.  
in the past few years, i started writing down a few, and it became a sport for me to pitch them to my close friends or anyone who would listen.  
what i want from you is a like, a comment, money, or nudes.   
i would love to hear your opinion about my farts.  
i will do my best to leave in some grammar and spelling mistakes, although it gets harder and harder with all these new tools like grammarly.  

a big thank you to flo-bit for creating this blog template and so many other things for me.  
he is also my biggest critic (rightly so) and sometimes shows his approval of my farts when he steals one and claims that it was his idea.  
and to unbedenklich, without him nothing would exist.
